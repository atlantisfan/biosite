                <p>Matthew Evens has enjoyed a variety of hobbies over the years although one has taken him to some of the most obscure places, his love of golf. Matthew began playing golf with his father and it grew through his teens and into his collegiate years where he even took classes to improve his game. If possible, he carries his clubs on road trips and plays at whatever golf courses he comes across. Serving as Best Man at a friend's wedding, he played at the Hideout Golf course in the small town of Monticello, Utah which is rated as one of the best in the state.</p>

                <p> As mentioned, his love for sports is unparalleled, however the many aspects of this passion are not limited to the field or court. Matt has lead music for youth groups, church services, concerts, and ragtag gatherings. He's sung in choirs, solos, duets, and even written several of his own songs, one of which he sang to his bride at their wedding. Music, sports, photography, woodworking, computer programming, and teaching blend together in the mosaic of his life.</p>
