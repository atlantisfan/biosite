From being an avid fan of his states college team, the Huskers, to watching Michael Jordan on as he played for the Bulls. particularly in basketball, Matt played actively in sports during his homeschool and particularly excelled at basketball with his father as coach. The interest followed him into highschool and earned him the position of team captain by his junior year.</p>
            
            <p>Matt played and toured with his academy team, the Eagles, across the mid-west throughout his highschool years. While Matt participated actively in most of the intramural sports, his passion was running plays on the court and ever improving his team's plays. When asked what his drive was on court, Matt simply stated that he was in a competition, but that the competition was with himself, to see if he could achieve higher than he had before. This philosophy stuck with him into college.</p>
