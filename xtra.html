        <h2>Fun with Power Tools</h2>
        <p>Matt enjoys working with his hands. Hobbies that involve physical movement are essential. Matt has always had a deep creative side that expressed in drawing, graphic design, photography, and wood working.</p>
        <p>What started out as a hobby has grown into a small business and means to channel his creativity and love for design using a CNC machine. A CNC machine is a Computer Numerical Controlled device that removes layers of material from a stock piece. Matt has used his creativity to generate placks, commemorative signs and art pieces with the CNC machine. Even creating a large sliding barn door for to cover an open hallway in his home. Today he continues to work with new materials to create more exotic artistic masterpieces.</p>
        <p>From Placards to signs, to customized iPhone cases, Matt creates marvels that have become gifts for friends and purchases for the world on Etsy. </p>
